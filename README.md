# MatPlotLib-Challenge
Utilizing Python's MatPlotLib to analyze a dataset of a real-world situation.

# General Observations:
##### From the provided data, the final average tumor volumes both Capomulin and Ramicane treated mice appeared to be similarlly reduced, with the Capomulin treated mice showing slightly better improvements. 
##### The correlation chart shows that there is a linear correlation between the average weight of the mouse and the average tumor volume i.e. the heavier the mouse, the larger the tumor volume. However, we would need to analyze further to see if the correlation between male mouse and their weights would be similar to their female counterparts.
##### Other points to note: (1) Furhter tests might be conducted to verify if 'test drugs' like Capomulin and Ramicane could further reduce the average tumor volumes past the 45-day study.
